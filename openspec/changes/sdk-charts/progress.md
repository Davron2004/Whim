# Progress ledger: sdk-charts

Dispatcher-owned run ledger. Append every disposition as it happens. The ledger + the chain/wip branches are the resume state if the dispatcher's context dies mid-change.

## Run metadata

- **run-start** (2026-07-18): staging branch `integration/sdk-charts`, MAIN_TIP `80816964c81469eb6d9130c991f818a6514f2163`
- schema: whim-harness
- chains: 3 (linear DAG: chain-1 → chain-2 → chain-3)
- FIXLOOP_INTEGRATION_BRANCH=integration/sdk-charts (passed inline to every fixloop.sh invocation this run)

## Chain DAG

| Chain | Tasks | Depends on | Scope |
|---|---|---|---|
| chain-1 sdk-chart-geometry | 1.1–1.5 | — | new geometry module in `src/sdk/`, Node suite |
| chain-2 sdk-chart-component | 2.1–2.5 | chain-1 (chart-geometry.md) | `src/sdk/charts.tsx`, `src/sdk/index.tsx` |
| chain-3 gallery-docs-closeout | 3.1–3.4 | chain-2 (chart-props.md) | `fixtures/style-gallery.app.tsx`, `docs/*.md` |

## Dispositions

<!-- append below, newest last -->

- **dispatched** chain-1 sdk-chart-geometry — BASE `80816964c81469eb6d9130c991f818a6514f2163` (= staging tip = MAIN_TIP), worktree `.claude/worktrees/sdk-charts-1`, branch `chain/sdk-charts-1`
- **report** chain-1 — STATUS complete, GATE PASS, commit `5cd00c5`. 5/5 tasks. Suite wired into `sdk:test` auto-glob (`src/sdk/test/*.acceptance.ts` via run.mjs) — no package.json edit. Class-A deviations: `.acceptance.ts` naming (SDK idiom, not launcher `.suite.ts`); pure explicit-`endDate` calendar anchor (no wall-clock, honors D7); stricter real-day-in-month validation; line zero-span mark centered at 0.5. Handoff `chart-geometry.md` written (75 lines).
- **integrity** chain-1 — exit 0, INTEGRITY OK. 3 files vs BASE, all in scope (`src/sdk/chart-geometry.ts`, `src/sdk/test/chart-geometry.acceptance.ts`, handoff). Main tree clean.
- **merged** chain-1 → `integration/sdk-charts` @ `c9adc28` (`--no-ff`). Ticked tasks 1.1–1.5.
- **regate-pass** chain-1 — `FAST GATE PASSED` on merged tip. Cleaned up worktree + branch.
- **dispatched** chain-2 sdk-chart-component — BASE `c9adc280095c80716a5866577d2fce3256f1a1df` (staging tip post chain-1), worktree `.claude/worktrees/sdk-charts-2`, branch `chain/sdk-charts-2`
- **report** chain-2 — STATUS complete, GATE PASS, commit `639aa06`. 5/5 tasks. Theme role→hex via `tokens.ts#color()` (same as controls/surfaces); `ChartTone ⊂ ColorToken`, no new tokens. Class-A deviation: used `switch (props.kind)` instead of cascading if/else — forced by a real TS discriminated-union narrowing limit (else-branch doesn't narrow to `heatmap`), documented in-source, no interface change. No wall-clock read; heatmap anchors to latest date in data. Handoff `chart-props.md` (68 lines).
- **integrity** chain-2 — exit 0, INTEGRITY OK. 3 files vs BASE, all in scope (`src/sdk/charts.tsx` new, `src/sdk/index.tsx` +6 re-export, handoff).
- **merged** chain-2 → `integration/sdk-charts` @ `5822c0d` (`--no-ff`). Ticked tasks 2.1–2.5.
- **regate-pass** chain-2 — `FAST GATE PASSED` on merged tip. Committed bookkeeping (tasks/ledger) as its own commit. Cleaned up worktree + branch.
- **dispatched** chain-3 gallery-docs-closeout — BASE `b5ea8ec08aeab292ffa0ff3722cff6e54614ca16` (staging tip post chain-2 + bookkeeping), worktree `.claude/worktrees/sdk-charts-3`, branch `chain/sdk-charts-3`
- **report** chain-3 — STATUS complete, GATE PASS, commit `cc9f38c`. 4/4 tasks. Gallery Charts section (bar/line/heatmap + empty-data placeholder) added to existing `style-gallery.app.tsx`, no new fixture file, `capabilities: []` preserved. `decisions.md` #47; `v1-roadmap.md` #4 → implemented 2026-07-18; `capabilities.md` pointer wording aligned (stale proposal row updated, not duplicated). Docs mirror source exactly. Class-A deviation: reworded existing capabilities.md pointer instead of adding a dup.
- **integrity** chain-3 — exit 0, INTEGRITY OK. 5 files vs BASE, all in scope (4 docs + `fixtures/style-gallery.app.tsx`).
- **merged** chain-3 → `integration/sdk-charts` @ `bdf568b` (`--no-ff`). Ticked tasks 3.1–3.4.
- NOTE for archive: `capabilities.md` still points at `openspec/changes/sdk-charts/specs/...`; the pointer needs a final flip to `openspec/specs/sdk-charts/` when `/opsx:archive` syncs the spec (chain-3 flagged this).
- **regate-pass** chain-3 — `FAST GATE PASSED`. Cleaned up worktree + branch. Staging tip `433dcb4`.
- **gate-full PASS** (step 10) on `433dcb4` — Chromium invariants + bridge invariants green, knip, guard:metro, codex-sync, `openspec validate` (change/sdk-charts ✓) all pass. `FULL GATE PASSED`.
- **reviewer dispatched** (step 11) — diff range MAIN_TIP `80816964` → staging tip `433dcb4`.
- **reviewer verdict** — CHANGES REQUESTED, 1 high (report-mismatch) + 1 low (nit). Reviewer independently ran sdk:test/build/invariants (all green), reproduced the TS-narrowing repro, and confirmed the date math is genuinely TZ/DST-immune (Hinnant days_from_civil, TZ-mutating suite). Otherwise conforms.
  - HIGH: `docs/sdk-reference.md:133` documents `maxValue` as `(bar/line/heatmap)`, but D2's union carries it on bar/line only (heatmap has no `maxValue`; `renderHeatmap` passes none). Doc contradicts the code-fence at 141–142 in the same file. Fix = correct the doc (union is source of truth), not the code.
  - LOW (won't-fix): gallery fixture uses `new Date()` to synthesize demo dates — D7 is scoped to `chart-geometry.ts`/`charts.tsx` (both confirmed Date-free); fixture seed data is fine. Non-blocking.
- **fix-chain dispatched** — `fix/sdk-charts-docfix` from staging tip `433dcb4` for the HIGH doc-fidelity finding.
- **fix-chain report** — STATUS complete, GATE PASS, commit `8e45b67`, only `docs/sdk-reference.md` (1 line). Integrity exit 0 (1 file). Merged @ `a5b1a94` (`--no-ff`), regate `FAST GATE PASSED`, worktree cleaned. HIGH finding resolved; doc now mirrors the union (bar/line only).
- LOW nit left as won't-fix (gallery fixture `new Date()` for seed data — out of D7 scope, reviewer agreed non-blocking).

## Closure (2026-07-18, unattended)

- **push DENIED** — `git push origin integration/sdk-charts` refused (`git push is human-approved only … class-B deviation`). Remote writes (push/fetch/force-push) need a human at the terminal; user asleep → unreachable. Per user's explicit standing authorization ("merge it to main … if you won't be able to reach sonar, just treat it as done"), fell back to the local ratified merge.
- **ratified merge → LOCAL main** `7c01c1d` (`--no-ff`), main was a clean ancestor of the staging tip. Merged tree is byte-identical to the gate-full-verified staging tip (`git diff integration/sdk-charts main` empty); fast gate green on main. **The waiting agent is unblocked — local `main` now contains `sdk-charts`.**
- **DEFERRED to morning (all require a human / remote):**
  1. `git push origin main` (or push the staging branch → draft PR) — publish to origin.
  2. SonarCloud iteration — needs the push; not run. Ledger `openspec/critic/sonar-ledger.md` NOT appended (no findings transcribed, since no Sonar round-trip happened).
  3. `/git-cleanup` (target=`integration/sdk-charts`) — history-squash + force-push, human-gated; skipped. Main currently carries the honest chain-structured history (3 chain merges + 1 fix merge + bookkeeping commits).
  4. Teardown — staging branch `integration/sdk-charts` KEPT (local + remote-remnant) so the morning remote flow is possible; NOT deleted.
- **archive note** (for `/opsx:archive`): `capabilities.md` pointer still targets `openspec/changes/sdk-charts/specs/...` — flip to `openspec/specs/sdk-charts/` when the spec syncs.

## Closing summary (step 13)

- **Chains:** 3 planned (linear DAG) + 1 reviewer fix chain. All merged, no parks, no halts.
  - chain-1 sdk-chart-geometry → `c9adc28` · chain-2 sdk-chart-component → `5822c0d` · chain-3 gallery-docs-closeout → `bdf568b` · fix `a5b1a94`.
- **Redispatches:** 0 (every chain passed its self-gate + integrity on first dispatch).
- **Deviations:** all Class-A, none proposal-invalidating — `.acceptance.ts` suite naming (SDK glob idiom); pure explicit-`endDate` calendar anchor (honors D7 no-wall-clock); stricter real-day-in-month validation; line zero-span mark centered at 0.5; `switch` for TS union narrowing (forced by a real narrowing limit, reproduced); capabilities.md pointer reworded not duplicated.
- **Reviewer verdict:** CHANGES REQUESTED → 1 HIGH (doc `maxValue` applicability) fixed via the fix chain; 1 LOW (fixture `new Date()`) accepted as won't-fix. Re-verified: doc now mirrors the union. Reviewer independently ran sdk:test/build/invariants and confirmed TZ/DST-immune date math.
- **Gates:** every inner attempt fast-gated; `gate-full` green twice (post-chain-3 tip `433dcb4`, and final tip after the fix). Chromium invariants unchanged — charts add no containment surface.
- **MEMORY proposals:** none from any implementer (all reported "none"); nothing durable to record.
